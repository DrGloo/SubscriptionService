# SubscriptionService
Subscription Service is a module that utilizes Developer Products to allow developers to create Subscriptions costing Robux rather than real currency, unlike Roblox’s built-in feature for subscriptions. In short, it is a good alternative to Roblox’s flawed built in Subscription feature. Authored by SECRXETT, I'm just irritating further on it.
